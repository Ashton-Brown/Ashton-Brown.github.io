      <p>Hi! I'm Ashton Brown. I love seeing the smiles when concepts finally click!</p>

      <p>I discovered my love for learning during those "aha!" moments in my early education. Now, I work to help others find those same moments of clarity—whether it's understanding a tricky calculus concept or finally making sense of Newton's laws.</p>

      <p>With years of experience tutoring students in both math and physics, I bring a calm, patient approach to each session. I aim to make complex topics feel approachable, intuitive, and maybe even a little fun.</p>
